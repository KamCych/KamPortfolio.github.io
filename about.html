                At university I'm a strong learner and love to help my classmates debug code! At home,
                I program different kinds of games and programs, always learning or just having fun.

            <h2>When I make games, I focus on unique gameplay concepts, 
                so I like to program retro games, and code features from scratch.
                Creating original ideas encourages me to develop games in a variety of styles,
                including 2D and 3D, with retro or low poly graphics.

                        and implemented. It helps me build my knowledge in game development, and prepares me for
                        developing my own ideas.
